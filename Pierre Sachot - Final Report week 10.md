# Working inside Kichwa Coders LTD!

## I - Context

I'm a French student, from Plaisance-du-touch, a small town near Toulouse in the south of France, and did my first 2 uni years inside an Institute of Technologie in Blagnac.
For my last year, I needed to do an internship of minimum 10 weeks to validate my final year. To improve my English, take some indepence and discover outside firm spirit, I choose to do my internship in an other country, but this country needed to be an english country.
My conception professor knew Kichwa Coders LTD because of Eclipse conferences, so he asked Tracy Miranda to engage some interns inside Tracy and Jonah company's.

I started my internship the 3rd of April with two others student from my institute. We were well welcome by Tracy and Jonah, and we came to eat inside of a pizzeria.
The company doesn't have a dress code or specificites like that, which is, for me, something nice, you don't have the obligation to follow a dress code or a way to think.

## II - What did I learn?

Before this internship, I didn't know at all open-source software, that's why my choice was on this company. open-source software is a really interesting component of computer science, because there is a lot of questions in association with this sector. The first one is how to be remunerated? How to contribute? Can everybody contribute? Do it require special skills? How an entire company can work inside it? How to bring customers of open-source software?

This internship brings me a lot of responses in associations with that, and for me it's a really nice thing that we can ask any kind of questions inside of this company. I learned a lot about little companies, and people inside of them.

Technically, I learned a lot on Eclipse CDT Project and math uses in IT, because Eclipse CDT and January project were the projects on which I was working for the most part. CDT Project is the C/C++ version of Eclipse, so on this one we corrected some bugs and added some new Features as an option to enable, partially enable or disable a source not found editor which was display all the time when the user was debugging his program. More recently we worked on adding some new options to choose the version of MinGW that the user want to use.

## III - Good Points

The better point was the proximity with Jonah Graham and Tracy Miranda, because, if we needed something or were stuck by developping something, they helped us to find the way to do properly the things. They always be patient and were here to help us, Jonah told us clearly that we were her to learn, and that's really kind from him, because he could let us searching. 
The other nice thing was that we worked on a lot of technologies like Python, Java, plug-in development and projects like Eclipse CDT, January project, EASE, JUnit Tests, ParameterizeTests, integration and cross platform for January, Katacoda... 
We saw a lot of advance codes because we needed to understand the previous codes to implement or correct the codes.

This experience inside Kichwa Coders LTD company is really helpful for us and our futur, because in comparaison to other people of our IT, we learned a lot of new things and works on big projects, Jonah and Tracy trust us to work on big projects and gave us some targets, which is for me a really kind proof of trust.

More than that, an other thing I liked inside of this company is that we hadn't deadlines, we were developping with our skills at our speeed. Nobody were under us to stress us or anything of this kind. We were taking our break when we wanted, nobody was checking the hour or things like that, this company is based on trust and freedom, which is something good for me, everybody is more happy like this, but this system need to work with everybody, and employeees need to don't take avantage from that.

## IV - Bad Point

For me, the badest thing during this internship is that we were three french inside of this company, so for the most part of time, between us, we were talking french... I wanted to improve a lot my english, and I think that this is the bad point of this internship, because I didn't talk as much as I expected english. 

The second point is that High Wycombe is at approximatly 20 minutes in train from London, but this cost a lot... 26Â£ to a return ticket, that's why my english speaking was limited too.

About the company itself, there is no bad points for me, like I said and explained before in the "Good Points" paragraph, this is a really interesting company, the only thing I could say is that we changed a lot of projects, like every weeks at the begininng, so if you were adapt to the technologie at the end of the week, it was not the case at the beginning of the week. But after, at the end of the internship, you begin to be adapt on all the projects, so it's really nice to change too, that's why it's not a truly bad point.

The thing which can be change is that we didn't have a really project to do during the entire internship, but to participate to some projects, but for our internship report, we need to have one project and to give some informations on it, like a gantt diagram, so it's a little bit more complicated to do that without a projects to do.

## Conclusion

Working inside Kichwa Coders LTD was a real pleasure for me even if I know that open-source software isn't the way I will take, because I'm really interested in IA and robotics, but the team and all the knowledge I learned make this internhsip really useful and is a great human value for me.
